## Project  

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Treasure DAO Hunt  
- **Category**: gaming - Games, NFTs, entertainment  

### Description
**Treasure DAO Hunt** is an on-chain *scavenger hunt* game where players explore quests and clues to find digital treasures.  
Each milestone is validated through zkProofs, allowing players to prove progress without revealing sensitive data.  
Rewards include unique NFTs and DAO utility tokens, giving players both fun gameplay and real economic incentives.  

### SL Integration  
Treasure DAO Hunt will integrate **Soundness Layer** to:  
- Verify zkProofs of quest completion.  
- Use zkID to prevent multi-account abuse and bots.  
- Enable reward distribution (NFTs/tokens) only upon valid proof verification.

## Technical  

### Architecture
1. **Frontend (React)** → Treasure Map & Quest Tracker UI.  
2. **Smart Contracts (Solidity)** → Quest logic & reward distribution.  
3. **zkApp + Soundness Layer** → Validate puzzles and progress privately.  
4. **Reward System** → NFT minting + DAO token payout.  

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + WalletConnect  
- **Backend**: Node.js (API + orchestration)  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (zk verification), EVM testnet for assets  
- **Storage**: IPFS (for clues & quest metadata)  

### Features
1. On-chain quest and clue mechanics.  
2. zkProof-based progress validation.  
3. NFT and tokenized reward system.

## Timeline  

### PoC (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic quest and reward contracts  
- [ ] Initial Soundness Layer integration (zkProof verification)  
- [ ] Simple UI for treasure map and quest tracker  

### MVP (4–8 weeks)  
- [ ] Multi-level quest system  
- [ ] Full NFT + token reward integration  
- [ ] Community user testing with DAO participants

## Innovation
- **Fairness-first gaming** → zkProofs ensure every step is validated fairly.  
- **Privacy-preserving** → no personal identity disclosure needed.  
- **DAO-driven content** → future quests can be created by the community.  
- **Hybrid rewards** → unique NFTs plus DAO tokens for dual value.
